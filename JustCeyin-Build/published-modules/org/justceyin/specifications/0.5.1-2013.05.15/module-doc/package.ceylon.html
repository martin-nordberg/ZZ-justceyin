 Package contains classes for defining behavior-driven development style specifications.
 
 Two styles of specification are supported by this package: imperative and declarative.
 
 **Imperative Specifications**

 * Inherit from `ImperativeSpecification`.
 * Implement a number of test methods, each taking a callable outcomes parameter.
 * Each test method should call outcomes with one or more expectations, generally started by `expect(..)...`
 * Define an actual `tests` member that collects the test methods into a sequence. 
   (Subject to change when Ceylon implements annotations.)
 
 **Declarative Specifications**

 * Inherit from `DeclarativeSpecification`.
 * Implement the `requirements` attribute which maps from requirement summary strings to `Requirement`
   instances.
   (Subject to change when Ceylon implements annotations.)
 
 It is also possible to combine the two approaches in a specification derived from `MixedSpecification`.
